        CONCAT(
        (LEFT([TransactionDate],4)),RIGHT(LEFT([TransactionDate],7),2),RIGHT(LEFT([TransactionDate],10),2)
        ) AS PKIDDate
        ,[TransactionDate]
    FROM [Sales].[Customers] AS customers
    LEFT OUTER JOIN
        [Sales].[CustomerTransactions] AS customertransactions
        ON customers.CustomerID = customertransactions.CustomerID;

    ```
    CustomerName, TransactionAmount, OutstandingBalance, TaxAmount, TransactionDate, Season, Holiday, Promo, PKIDDate
    ```

    >**Note:** The above list can be copied from: **E:\Labfiles\Lab05\Columns.txt**.
   
11. Note that the **Comma separated list of datatable columns** box is for names of the columns as you wish them to appear in the destination table, but for this exercise you will use the same names as in the source data.
12. Run the experiment, by clicking **RUN** at the bottom of the page.
13. Click **SAVE** at the bottom of the page.

#### Task 3: Confirm data export

1. Switch to the Azure Portal tab.
