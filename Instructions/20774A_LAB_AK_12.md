9. When you are prompted, enter **sadmin** and **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd** as the credentials.

#### Task 4: Browse cluster storage

> **Note**: The commands in this task are case-sensitive. They can be copied from **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab12\\Ex1Task4Cmds.txt** and pasted by right-clicking the SSH console window.

1. In the SSH console window, type the following command to view the contents of the root folder in the HDFS file system:
    ```
    hdfs dfs -ls /
    ```
2. Type the following command to view the contents of the **/example** folder in the HDFS file system. This folder contains subfolders for sample apps, data, and JAR components:
    ```
    hdfs dfs -ls /example
    ```
3. Type the following command to view the contents of the **/example/data/gutenberg** folder, which contains sample text files:
